  Feature: Suggest a template
    As an administrator,
    I want to provide alternate template names.

    Scenario: No template override used for articles prior to configuring module.
      Given I am logged in as a user with the "create article content" permissions
      And I visit "node/add/article"
      And I fill in "Title" with "First Article Node"
      And I press the "Save" button
      # todo, update name
      Then I should not see the text "The file node--longform-prose.html.twig from template_mapper_test_theme"
      Then I should see the text "The file node.html.twig from template_mapper_test_theme"

    Scenario: No template override used for pages prior to configuring module.
      Given I am logged in as a user with the "create page content" permissions
      And I visit "node/add/page"
      And I fill in "Title" with "Page Node"
      And I press the "Save" button
      # todo, update name
      Then I should not see the text "The file node--marketing-message.html.twig from template_mapper_test_theme"

      # @todo make permissions specific to this module.
      #Given I am logged in as a user with the :permissions
      #  | permissions                   |
